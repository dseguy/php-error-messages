description = "In an array notation, the offset may be a variable, or any container. Yet, it must be a string or an integer; and when applied to an string, it must be an integer.

This error is reported when a value which type is not cast to integer (such as ``null``, ``boolean``, ``float``) or string is used. Here, it is an object. 

It is also a specific message, emitted when the error happens as an argument of ``isset`` or ``empty``. Both function have an error suppression feature, and yet, this error is reported."

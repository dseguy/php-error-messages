description = "The pipe operator accepts many variants of closures, such as closures, callable, arrays and first class callables. Yet, it doesn't accept direct arrow functions: they must be placed inside parenthesis. This ensures the parser knows when to finish the returned expression, which might also include another pipe operator."

description = "When using asymetric visibility, it is not allowed to have a weaker (public) visibility for writing than for reading (private). This would be akin to a variable which can be written from the public scope, which is accessible to the class, but not read from that scope. As such, the set visibility must be at most the same than the get one. 

Using the same level of visibility with both options is possible, although useless.

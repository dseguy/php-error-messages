description = "The trait X has a property, which is typed with a relative type: ``parent``. Yet, as a trait, there is no parent class possible. 

This situation is solved when the trait is ``use``d in a class, as long as the class has a parent. But it is not possible directly on the trait.

This error is now covered with the upcoming deprecation of direct manipulation of static properties on a trait, without using its host class. 

This error is also possible with ``self``. It is not possible with static, as properties can't be typed static. 

This error is also possible on interfaces.

The code above could be understood as `($a ? $b : $c) ? $d : $e` or `$a ? $b : ($c ? $d : $e)`. Until PHP 8.0, the engine choose the second option; Since then, it must be explicitly written.

Note that, in the error message, the letters represent a full expression. They may be variables, as in the illustration, but any other expression."

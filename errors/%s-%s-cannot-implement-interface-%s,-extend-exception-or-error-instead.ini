description = "``Throwable`` is a PHP native and reserved interface. It may be used for typing, such as with ``catch`` or parameter typing, but cannot be used directly. 

As the message suggest, the best is to extends an existing class that already implements ``Throwable``, such as ``Error``, ``Exception`` or any of their children classes.

Several interfaces are reserved by PHP: ``UnitEnum``, ``BackedEnum``, ``Throwable``.

description = "The third argument of define() used to allow the creation of a case-insensitive global constant. The constant in the code would have been accessible with `A` or `a`, without distinction. This feature has been deprecated in PHP 7.3 and abandoned in PHP 8.0. For backward compatibility, the third argument is not reported as an error, but a warning. The constant is not case insensitive any way. Adding a fourth argument is a fatal error, and has no meaning."

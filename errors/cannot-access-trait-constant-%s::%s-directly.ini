description = "Traits cannot be used indepently from a host class. They must be used inside a class, with the ``use`` keyword. 

It is also not possible to call a method or a property on a trait.

Trait constants were introduced after direct access to trait features was banned, so there was no time where accessing a trait constant was possible, unlike trait properties or methods."

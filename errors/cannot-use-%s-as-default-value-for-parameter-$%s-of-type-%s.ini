description = "The default value of the parameter is not compatible with the type of the same parameter. In the example here, the paramter ``$s`` is supposed to be an integer, but has a string as default value.

This error also applies to numeric strings: the default value must be of the same type, without any silent type juggling.

It used to be recommended to make the default value ``NULL`` as it would be implicitely accepted by the type. Yet, in PHP 8.4, this is now a deprecated behavior, and it is not recommended anymore.

description = "This error arises when a PHP token is used where a name is expected. There is a conflict between the PHP token, which has its own meaning, and the expected name, which is a 'T_STRING' token.

This happens with any named structure, such as CITE, functions and global constants. It is legit with class constants and methods. 

The identifier can be any string, that satisfy the regex ``^[a-zA-Z_\x80-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x80-\xff]*$``, and is not a PHP keyword.

This error is case insensitive, like PHP keywords."

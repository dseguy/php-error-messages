description = "get_class() used to allow its usage without an argument. Then, it would return the current class context, at compile time. Hence, in the code here, it used to return ``x``, may it be called from ``x`` or ``y``. 

This behavior is not allowed anymore, and will be removed in PHP 9.

Note that calling get_class without an argument was different from calling get_class with the ``null`` value."

description = "The list() (also known as [] on the left side of the = sign), can skip some values, by using consecutive commas. This feature is only available with positional list(), which assign the n-th argument to the n-th element of the array.

Since PHP 7.1, list() accepts named element: this feature match the keys with their equivalent in the array, instead of matching the positions. With that feature, skipping an element in the array is useless: it is also not accepted by the PHP engine. "

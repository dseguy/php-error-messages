description = "Commas are used as a separator in lists of items, such as parameters, arguments, elements of an array. When such list is supposed to have only one element, the syntax error appears. 

This happens with ``switch``, ``match()``, ``if()``, or parenthesis, which all allow one expression, not two, although they might be confused with a function call.

It also happens with curly braces, which uses semi-colon ``;`` as a separator.

The unexpected ``,`` appears when there is nothing between separators: for example, an empty argument, or a missing variable in a ``global`` call. The only situation where it is acceptable is inside a ``list()`` expression."

description = "Pre or post increment on a ``null`` leaves the value unchanged. While PHP updates strings, integers, floats with the post- or pre-increment operators, null are immune. 

Until PHP 8.3, it was silently done. In PHP 8.3, it raises a deprecation warning, and it will be removed in PHP 9.0. 

Post increment, pre increment, as well as increment and decrement are affected by that warning. str_increment() and str_decrement() refuses to use null, due to type."

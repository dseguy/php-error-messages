description = "This error appears when an array is converted into a string, without a proper type cast. For example, in the illustration code, the array is directly used with ``echo``, which requires a string, as argument. The result of this expression is ``Array``.

This error may be a sub-part of other operations, that also requires strings. This is the second example, with ``implode()`` : the source of the error lies in the elements of the array. They are supposed to be strings, so as to be concatenated with the separator; but one of them is also an array, leading to the error.

This error is not affected by ``strict_types``: it is always emits the same error."

alternative[] = "Extract one (or more) entries from the array, as long as they are strings."
alternative[] = "Force the array to a string with cast (although it will produce the ``Array`` string)."

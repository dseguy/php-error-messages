description = "PHP 8.3 introduced str_increment() and str_decrement(), which update strings by changing the last character's ascii code. It mirrors a famous PHP easter egg, where a string may be incremented with the ``++`` operator. 

In PHP 8.5, this feature is deprecated, and a warning is emitted. There is no deprecation warning for decrementing, as the feature was not implemented on strings."

description = "Null, boolean (true and false), integers and floats are not valid with the array syntax. That syntax uses the square brackets with an index, appended after the value.

Often, such syntax is used on returned values, which may be an array, or false (or null) in case of error: most of the time it is a valid array, but sometimes, it is a scalar type. Such usage is now reported since PHP 8.3."

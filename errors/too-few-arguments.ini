description = "Functions such as ``printf()`` require at least one argument, the format. In that argument, the function will identify and require more arguments, passed after this first one. When there is not enough arguments for the first one, this error appears.

Not that extra arguments are ignored silently by PHP.

This applies to ``printf()``, ``sprintf()``, ``fprintf()``."

description = "The type of the returned value must match the type of the method signature. 

With strict_types, PHP refuses anything that is not compatible with the returned type: returning '123' (123 as a string), or 123.00 (123 as float) is forbidden. 

Without strict_types, PHP tries to convert the value to int, and only produces an error when it cannot."

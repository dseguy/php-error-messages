description = "In PHP 8.0, the ``match`` statement was added to PHP feature: it is a similar feature to ``switch``. ``match`` is now a PHP reserved keyword, and, as such, cannot be used everywhere. For example, it cannot be used as a class, function or interface name; it cannot be used in a function call, although it may be used in method call."

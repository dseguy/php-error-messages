description = "When there is no need to define a constructor, it may be skipped. Then, PHP creates the object without that initial method call.

On the other hand, if a child class makes an explicit call to the parent constructor, then on of the parents MUST have a constructor. 

In the example here, the child class explicitely calls the parent constructor, but it doesn't exists."

description = "list() is a construct that maps an array to a set of variables. The assignation is done by position, or by key. By position, this means the first value of the array goes to the first variable of the list() : in that case, list() doesn't specify keys with the => operator. On the other hand, the key are matched by their value, and not their position. The error here happens when list() syntax is created with a mixed set of position and key assignations."

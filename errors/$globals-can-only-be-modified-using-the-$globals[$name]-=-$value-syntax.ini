description = "Since PHP 8.1, it is not possible to replace ``$GLOBALS`` entirely. It has to be modified at the index level, and not as a whole. 

The error message is a bit misleading: on the spot operations with index are still possible, such as ``++`` or ``array_map`` or ``array_walk``.

This means that ``$GLOBALS['index']`` may be written, while ``$GLOBALS``  cannot. 

``$GLOBALS['index']`` and ``$GLOBALS`` can still be used for reading.

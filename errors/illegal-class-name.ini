description = "Illegal class name is a compile-time error when the type of a value, used for a class is not valid. 

The expressions that use classes are the following : static method call, static property call, static constant call, and static class (``$a::class``). 

The valid types are strings, static class (``A::class``), identifiers (such as ``A`` or ``\A``), method calls (``foo()``) that returns one of the previous types or data containers holding an object or a class name as a string. On the other hand, boolean, null, integers, float, array() are invalid; some strings are not valid, such as '4foo', though PHP only detects these are execution time, with a different error message.

This kind of error is very rare, as it prevents the code to run."

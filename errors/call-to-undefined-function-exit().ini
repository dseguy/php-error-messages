description = "exit and die used to be language constructures, until PHP 8.4. Then, they could not be used in a dynamic function call, such as shown here. Indeed, language constructs are not accessible with that syntax.

Since PHP 8.4, ``die`` and ``exit`` are defined as functions, and shall be used with the dynamic call feature.

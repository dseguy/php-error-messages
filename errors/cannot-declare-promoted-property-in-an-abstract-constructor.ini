description = "It is not possible to use a promoted property in an abstract constructor. The promoted property is akin to concrete code (the property assignation), while the abstrat constructor has no body. 

On the other hand, a child class may overwrite the constructor signature with a promoted property, so it is possible to define properties that way, but not on an abstract method.

In order to enforce a property, from an abstract class, the property must be defined out of the constructor.

description = "If-then commands are standalone commands. They can't be part of another expression. Here, PHP found the ``if``, while it was expecting another expression. 

Then, PHP mentions that it was expecting ``)``: this usually hints at an unclosed method call syntax. In the example here, the previous line holds an unclosed function call to ``foo``.

description = "Until PHP 7.3, PHP required an object as the left operand of ``instanceof``. In recent versions, PHP does not emit an error anymore, and returns null.

Although the function reports a constant problem, the error is reported with literal values, and not with constants.

Constants were allowed to receive objects in PHP 8.1."

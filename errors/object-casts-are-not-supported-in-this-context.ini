description = "Cast operators are not supported in a static constant expression. They look like any other operator, such as ``+`` or ``.``, but they require data manipulations which are incompatible with constant expressions.

This applies to all casts operations: ``(int)``, ``(string)``, ``(bool)``, ``(array)``, ``(object)``, ``(void)``.

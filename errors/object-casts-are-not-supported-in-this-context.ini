description = "All cast operators are not supported in a static constant expression. This applies to all casts operations: ``(int)``, ``(string)``, ``(bool)``, ``(array)``, ``(object)``, until PHP 8.5. In PHP 8.5 and later, only ``(object)`` is not supported.

They look like any other operator, such as ``+`` or ``.``, but they require data manipulations which are incompatible with constant expressions.

While it may be useless to apply a cast to a literal value, it might be useful to use it with another expression or another constant."

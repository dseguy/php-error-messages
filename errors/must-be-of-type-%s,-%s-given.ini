description = "This error message reports that the types of the provided arguments are not compatible with the expected types. 

Such a conflict appears in various situations: 
+ a scalar type is used when another incompatible type is expected: using an array instead of a integer.
+ a compatible type is provided when strict_types is active: for example, using a numeric string or a stringable object with a ``string`` type.
+ a parent class is used where a child type is expected: object types accept child classes, not parent ones.
+ the type is an interface, and the provided object is not implementing it explicitely
+ the type has a typo
+ the type should is not the one that is the specifications."

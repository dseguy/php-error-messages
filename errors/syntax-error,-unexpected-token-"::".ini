description = "In this situation, the keyword ``or`` is reserved by PHP and cannot be used as a class name, a function name, or a global constant. 

By extension, the ``or`` keyword cannot be used in static object notations, such as calling a constant, or a static method or property.

This error may arise with other keywords, such as ``switch``, ``and``, ``foreach``, etc, for similar reasons. It also may happen when a new keyword is reserved by PHP, between two versions.

The error also appears when the left operand of the ``::`` is missing, or not applicable. Here, there is an illustration with ``echo``.

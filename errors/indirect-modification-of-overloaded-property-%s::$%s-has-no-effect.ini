description = "The variable $object is an object. Since it implements the __get magic method, any property is available. 

While the syntax makes $object->something looks like a actual property and an array, not all operations are available. It is possible to get any property's value, or to give it a new value; but it is not possible to use the append operator : this is not supported by the magic method.

There are different variations of that situation : for example, an increment or decrement on the value on a property is not possible either. 

There is no call that will relay to the magic method that this property is being appended or incremented."

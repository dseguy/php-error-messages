description = "array_key_exists() used to accept both arrays and objects. In array cases, it looks for an index in the array keys, and in the object case, it looks for a property in the public properties. 

array_key_exists() only works with array: it doesn't work with ArrayAccess object, and yields the same error.

In PHP 7.4, this feature was deprecated, with the eponymous message. In PHP 8.0, it is now turned into a type error: the second argument must be an array."

description = "In this command, an attribute has been configured. The attributes can only precede a structure, such as a class, method or function. 

In this case, the attribute has been placed inside an expression, so only a closure can be declared: hence, the request for a ``function``, ``fn``. That closure could be ``static`` or have another attribute.

In the end, the closure is not compatible with the ``+`` or similar operator, so the suggestion is not valid here. It could be valid with a comma.

This error appears after PHP 8.0: this is when the ``#[`` token was introduced. Until that version, ``#`` introduces a comment, until the end of the line."

description = "It is not possible to use one of the superglobal variable names as argument of a method: such code hides the assignation that happens at call time, which will interfere with the ``$_POST`` variable being a global. Hence, such syntax is forbidden. 

The error is not emitted when the same superglobal variables are used as variables, as it may be legit code.

This applies to all PHP superglobal, such as ``$_ENV``, ``$GLOBALS``, or ``$_POST``. See the full list in annex."

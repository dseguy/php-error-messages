description = "In an array notation, the offset may be a variable, or any container. Yet, it must be a string or an integer; and when applied to an string, it must be an integer.

This error is reported when a value which type is not cast to integer (such as ``null``, ``boolean``, ``float``) or string is used. Here, it is an object. 

Note that a class that extends ``ArrayAccess`` interface allows the manipulation of any kind of key: this is possible, yet rare.

This error message has been extended to more types than ``string`` : for example, ``array``.

description = "There was an attempt to use the ``Sqlite3`` database, while it is not yet initialised, or already closed. 

When extending the ``Sqlite3`` class, make sure the constructor calls the parent constructor, so that ``Sqlite3`` is actually initiliazed.

Note that the ``Sqlite3`` object was not unset yet, so it still exists. It would have been another error then."

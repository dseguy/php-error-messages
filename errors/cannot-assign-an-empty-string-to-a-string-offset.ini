description = "It is possible to access an individual character inside a string, and replace it with another character. 

On the other hand, it is not possible to remove that character by using an empty string. The only allowed modification is a replacement: one character replace another character. 

In fact, PHP will only use the first character, when trying to modify an offset with a string longer than one character."

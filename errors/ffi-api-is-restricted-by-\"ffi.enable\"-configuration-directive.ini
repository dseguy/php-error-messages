description = "FFI is an extension that allows loading C libraries, and building C data structure from PHP. This is a powerful interface, that comes with possible security concerns. Not only FFI must be compiled with PHP, but it also has to be allowed in the php.ini file to be executable.

Since this error message is provided by FFI, it means FFI is installed on the system, but it is not enabled in the php.ini.

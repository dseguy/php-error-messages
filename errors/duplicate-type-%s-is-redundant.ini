description = "When declaring a complex type, each part of the type must be unique. This means that a type can only be mentionned once.

This constraint is actually easier to explain than to detail: of course, it is important to avoid repeating the same type, yet types may be declared with different case, with or without initial slash, with a local alias, or also with a class_alias(). 

Then, there is also the possiblity for the type to be part of a composed type, such as bool (which is true|false), or mixed, or iterable, etc. 

Only the first redundant type is reported."

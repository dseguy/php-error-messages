description = "The array syntax ``$variable[index]`` is only available for arrays and strings. Yet, false is an edge case: PHP used to convert automatically, and silently, the boolean to array, when that syntax was used. This is called autovivification. 

The other boolean, ``true`` behaves the same way, with a different error message. 

This feature is used to initialize variables with false, and then convert it to array as needed. 

Since PHP 8.1, it is a deprecated behavior."

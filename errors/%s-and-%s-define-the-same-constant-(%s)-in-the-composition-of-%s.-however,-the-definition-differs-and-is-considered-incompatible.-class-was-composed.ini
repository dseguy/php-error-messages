description = "There is not conflict resolution, when a class and a trait defined the same constant. Both constants must be identical, or face the above error message. 

In order to be compatible, the constants in the class AND in the trait must have the same name, the same value (after eventual resolution of the expression), same visibility and the same type. 

In the case that the constant is defined in a parent class as ``private``, the trait may defined it again without conflict.

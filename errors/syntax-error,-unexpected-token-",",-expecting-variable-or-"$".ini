description = "This error is reported when a list of global variable is expected after the ``global`` keyword. 

There is a similar case with the visibility options ``public``, ``protected`` and ``private``, and the ``static`` keyword, although ``global`` is the only keyword with accepts variable variables.

Generally speaking, there can be no two successive commas in an expression, except with the ``list()`` keyword."

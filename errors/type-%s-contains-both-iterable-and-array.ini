description = "Since PHP 8.0 and the advent of union types, it is possible to write a type with duplicate type in it. This is obviously the case of the second function, in example.

It is less obvious to spot that ``array`` and ``iterable`` are redundant, yet, ``iterable`` = ``array|Traversable``. So, ``iterable`` is sufficient, to also cover ``array``.

This is a specific case of the general error that target any duplicate type in a definition."

description = "PHP reports that the object cannot be used as a boolean. Converting an object into a boolean is a PHP engine feature, and should be always on. Though, some extensions have not systematically implemented it.

Here, gmp is lacking the support for converting objects into a boolean, though it was fixed in PHP 8.4. When meeting such error, it should be reported to the author of the extension."

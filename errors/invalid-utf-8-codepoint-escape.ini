description = "PHP supports unicode as escape sequence. They are used in double-quoted strings, and use the ``\\u{73}`` format. The digits must represent a valid unicode codepoint: here, 73 represents the ASCII letter ``s``.

When the prefix ``\\u{`` is detected, PHP tries to understand the next characters as an integer. When this is not the case, it fails the codepoint detection and stops.

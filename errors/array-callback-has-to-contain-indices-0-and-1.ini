description = "PHP uses an array format to represents callback methods: it is an array with two elements. The first element is the class, and the second element is the method. To be valid, this array must also only use the index 0 and 1 (resp.) for these elements.

Also, note that this array must only have two elements.

With the explicit 0 and 1 indices, the order of the elements are not important in the array. With omitted indices, the order is important for PHP to differentiate which is the class, and which is the method.

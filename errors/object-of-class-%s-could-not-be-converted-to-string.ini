description = "PHP reports that the object cannot be used as a string. Converting an object into a string is only possible when the magic method ``__toString()`` is implemented, or when the interface ``Stringable`` is implemented.

In that case, the object is automatically converted into a string, thanks to that method. Otherwise, it is a Fatal error.

This is a distinct error than passing an object in a string argument: in that case, it is a Type error.

A lot of native PHP classes support the conversion, but not all of them. Check for ``stringable`` interface before using them.

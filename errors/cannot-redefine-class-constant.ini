description = "It is only allowed to defined a constant once per class. 

A constant with the same name may be defined in a parent or child class, or even in a trait: there are rules that allow PHP to select one of them, whenever there is a possible name conflict. 

At the class, interface, trait level, the constants must all be distinct. 

At the enumeration level, the naming conflict may arise between a case and a const: the error message is then the same.

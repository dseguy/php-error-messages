description = "This error reports that the object syntax was not expected there. 

One classic reason is the new syntax in PHP 8.4, where parenthesis are not necessary, right after a new, to call properties or methods. This syntax actually requires the parenthesis.

Another situation arise when a space is inserted between the ``?`` and the ``->`` operator. The space let PHP believe that a ternary operator is started, yet the ``->`` must be applied to an object."

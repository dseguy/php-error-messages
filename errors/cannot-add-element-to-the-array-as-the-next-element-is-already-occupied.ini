description = "This error appears when the largest PHP integer has been used as an index in an array. When appending a new item in the array, PHP calculates the largest index, and adds one. Though, in this situation, it is not possible anymore to create a new integer, since the last one was used.

This error appears when a value was stored ``out of the way``, yet the array is appended later."

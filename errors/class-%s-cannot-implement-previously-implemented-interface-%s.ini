description = "It is not allowed to use several times the same interface in a ``implements`` clause, for classes, or ``extends`` for interfaces.

The message is a bit confusing, since the interface is not already implemented, but rather, used in the implements clause. In fact, PHP checks first the list of names of the clause, then it checks the signatures of the methods.

This error message is dependent on the ``use`` expresion, and also the calls to ``class_alias()``.

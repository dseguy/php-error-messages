description = "The nullsafe operator is only available for reading, not writing. Aka, it cannot be used on the left side of an assignation.

The nullsafe operator replaces any non-existing property with a ``null`` value: that value is not an object, and cannot handle properties on its own.

This limitation applies to assignations, short assignations, such as ``.=``, ``+=``, etc., pre and post incrementations ``++$a->b``, and references arguments."

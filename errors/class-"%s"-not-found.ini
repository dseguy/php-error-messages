description = "This error message is reported when the class could not be loaded, or when the name of the class is invalid. 

It appears when the classes are defined after they are required. It applies to classes in the same file, and never with autoloading.

It also appears when unserializing an enumeration: PHP cannot distinguish a class constant or an enumeration case, so it reports a class error. Yet, this is the enuneration missing."

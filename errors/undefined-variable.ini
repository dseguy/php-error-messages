description = "This notice is emitted when a variable is being used before being defined. In a word, the variable is not created yet, so PHP creates it on the fly, as NULL, then uses it.

The situation arises when reading a variable, such as the ``echo`` call here. It doesn't happen upon writing, as it is the way to make a variable definition. 

It also happens when using the ``compact`` native function: it collects the values of variables into an array, and emits this error whenever the variable doesn't exist. The entry is also skipped in the result."

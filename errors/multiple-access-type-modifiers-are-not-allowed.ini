description = "Only one visibility option is necessary to set the visibility of a property. Two is overkill or could be impossible, so PHP reports it.

This message applies to private, protected and public options.

This message appears when compiling PHP 8.4+ code, with asymmetric visibility, against PHP 8.3 or older. In that case, ``protected(set)`` is not recognized as a token, and only the ``protected`` part is used, leading to the error.

There are similar messages for multiple readonly, or multiple static."

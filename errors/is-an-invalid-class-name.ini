description = "This error is emitted when a fully qualified name is used as a type (property, constant, parameter, returntype), and that cannot be a valid name. For example, this applies to ``\self``, ``\static``, ``\parent``. Other keywords, such as ``true``, ``null`` get a different error message. 

Note also that all keywords are not covered with this error message, and some have slipped through the checks: for example, ``\interface``, ``\class``, ``\enum``, ``\resource``... are all valid code. In fact, PHP won't create objects of such types, so this makes such type unusable. "

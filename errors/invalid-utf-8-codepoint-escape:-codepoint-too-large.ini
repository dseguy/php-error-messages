description = "PHP supports unicode as escape sequence. They are used in double-quoted strings, and use the ``\u{73}`` format. The digits must represent a valid unicode codepoint: here, 73 represents the ASCII letter ``s``.

When a valid escape sequence is detected, PHP use the integer between the curly braces. Unicode comprises 1,114,112 code points in the range 0 to 10FFFF. Beyond that value, codepoint are undefined, and do not represent anything anymore."

description = "Since PHP 8.1, PHP has been enforcing non-null parameters to PHP native functions. Until then, it was possible to use NULL everywhere, and it would have been cast to an empty string or 0. Nowadays, it is a deprecation.

This applies to all PHP native functions, such as, and not limited to: strtolower(), strip_tags(), trim(), addslashes(), strlen(), rtrim(), etc."

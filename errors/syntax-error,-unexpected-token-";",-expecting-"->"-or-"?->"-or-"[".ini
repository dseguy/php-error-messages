description = "The ``&`` reference operator turns a value into a reference. It works with data containers, such as variables, properties or array elements. It doesn't work on literal constants. 

The error message suggestion to use extra operators such as ``[`` or ``->`` leads to a distinct error: ``Cannot use temporary expression in write context``."

description = "The ``static`` keyword is a relative class identifier. It is resolved at execution time, depending on which class is calling the expression.

In the case of constants, such as class constants or default values in parameters or properties, they must be known at compile time, to be usable as soon as the application start. 

On the other hand, ``self`` and ``parent`` are valid relative values, as there can only be one.

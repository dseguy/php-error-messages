description = "Until PHP 8.4, it is possible to use a default value of null, on a parameter that is not nullable. This special situation makes the parameter nullable: it may be omitted, or explicitely passed as null. This is a hidden type, as the null type is not explicit, yet it is fully usable.

In PHP 8.4, this is not possible anymore. For consistency reasons, the type must be explicitly displayed. Until then, it was silent.

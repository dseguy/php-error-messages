description = "The first character of a regex is the delimiter, that delimits the regex. There is a first and a last delimiter. 

In the case of this error, the first regex character is of invalid type. It cannot be alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z and digits), nore the backslash ``\``. 

Note that if the first characters are white spaces, such as space, tabulation, new line, they are ignored as potential delimiter.

Later, the NUL character (``chr(0)``) was added to the list of the forbidden characters."

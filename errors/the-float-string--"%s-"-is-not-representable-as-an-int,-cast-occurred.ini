description = "The string contains a numeric value, that could be parsed, even partially. Yet, the resulting number is bigger than the larger supported integer ``PHP_INT_MAX``. At that point, PHP replace the parse numeric value to the maximum integer value. 

The problem does not happen with float numbers, which are converted to ``INF`` infinity when they can't be represented anymore.

This problem is often related to the presence of the ``e`` character in the string, which yield a possible float number."
alternative[] = "Use the string, rather than convert it to an integer."
alternative[] = "Check if the string can be converted before using the cast."
alternative[] = "Compare the resulting value with ``PHP_INT_MAX``: it might be very far from the expected conversion."

description = "``namespace``, when used in a fully qualified name, represents the current namespace. It is usually omitted. 

``self`` describes the current class. It is a relative class name, as it has no literal value. 

As such, ``self`` doesn't have an absolute path version, such as ``namespace\self``. Hence, the error emitted there.

This error is also emitted for ``static`` and ``parent``. 

Omitting the ``namespace`` keyword, and writing ``\self``, is also forbidden for the same reason."

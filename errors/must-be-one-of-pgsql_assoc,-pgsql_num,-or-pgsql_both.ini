description = "pg_fetch_all() 2nd argument must be one of 3 possible pgsql constants:  PGSQL_ASSOC, PGSQL_NUM and PGSQL_BOTH.

It is also the case of pg_fetch_array() and pg_fetch_row()'s 3rd argument; and pg_select()'s 4th argument.

It is possible to use raw integers, instead of the constants, although this is not recommended."

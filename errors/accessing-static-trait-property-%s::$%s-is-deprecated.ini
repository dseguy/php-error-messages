description = "Traits cannot be used independently from a host class. They must be used inside a class, with the ``use`` keyword. 

Until PHP 8.1, it was possible to call traits without a host class. Since 8.1, writing or reading properties in a trait is forbidden.

It is also not possible to call a method or a constant on a trait.

description = "The ``implements`` keyword must use an interface, and cannot use anything else. In particular, it cannot be another class, enumeration or trait. All four structures CITE (class, Interface, Trait and Enumeration) use the same namespaces, and they cannot be told apart by reading the name only. 

Indeed, when the structure has no definition, PHP reports ``interface-\"E\" not found``."

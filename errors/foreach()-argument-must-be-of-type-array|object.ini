description = "foreach() works on arrays or objects. 

For the arrays, all the elements of the array are read.

For the objects, it is either the public properties, read like an array; or the object has the Iterator interface: then, there is a list of specific methods to implements, which control how the object is traversed; the object may be a generator, which is a method that uses the ``yield`` keyword; finally, the object may be a PHP native iterator, or a child of them. 

Then, any other type is forbidden to be used with foreach(). This means all scalars elements, including string, integer and null. "

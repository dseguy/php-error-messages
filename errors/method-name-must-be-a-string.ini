description = "When using a dynamic syntax to call a method, the name of the method must be a string. It cannot be any other type, as no type juggling will take place. In particular, objects with ``toString`` are not converted to their string value.

Although method names have a specific format, this is not checked here, and the string is used raw.

Note that there is not equivalent for dynamic property names: they are cast to string as needed.

description = "There was an attempt to call a function whose name was provided in a variable, but that value could not be related to a callable code. 

+ ``null`` : not a callable
+ ``true``, ``false`` : booleans are not callable
+ ``int`` : integers are not callable
+ ``float`` : float are not callable
+ ``array`` : arrays are callable when they have two elements, with keys 0 and 1. First one is a class or an object of that class, the second is a string with a visible method name on that class. Otherwise, they are not valid callables.
+ ``string`` : strings are callable when they represent a function, with the leading backslash, ``\\strlen``, or a method, with a class name, a double colon ``::``, and a visible method name. Otherwise, they are not valid callables.
+ ``object`` : object are callable when their class has a ``__invoke`` method. This might be through a parent, like ``Closure``. Otherwise, objects are not callable, although their method are.

All of these may be checked with a call to ``is_callable()`` on the variable, before using it."

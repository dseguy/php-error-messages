description = "Until PHP 8.4, the assignation (first and final), of a readonly property had to be executed in the definition class. In the illustration, this means that ``$property`` must be assigned in the ``X`` class. This was applied all the time, without consideration for the visibility of the property.

Since PHP 8.4, visibility allowing, a readonly property may be defined in any of the child classes too."

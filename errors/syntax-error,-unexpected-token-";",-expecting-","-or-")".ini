With one parameter, the instruction must be closed with a closing parenthesis after the value expression; with multiple parameters, the parameters are separated by commas ``,``, and the last parameter is followed by a closing parenthesis. 

This error message is dedicated to ``declare``, as similar other syntaxes yield distinct error messages."

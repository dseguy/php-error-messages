description = "In PHP 4, the constructor of a class was the method with the same name as the class. In the example, the ``X::X`` method is the constructor. This was deprecated in PHP 7.0, in favor of using the ``__construct`` method.

During the deprecation phase, the eponymous method was still used as the constructor, if the ``__construct`` method was not available."

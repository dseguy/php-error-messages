description = "The initial autoloader was a custom function, that was called whenever a class, interface or trait had to be loaded, but could not be found by PHP yet.

This approach was useful, but limited management operation: in particular, it was not possible to add more functions, or remove some of them. So, it was replaced with the ``spl_autoload_register()`` function, which add a closure to a list of autoloaders."

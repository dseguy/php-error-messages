description = "This error is related to ``match`` being a PHP keyword. Since PHP 8.0, it cannot be used anymore as a class or interface name. When moving from PHP 7 to 8, any traditional usage of ``match`` where a class name is expected shall produce such an error.

In the illustrations, no more details are provided about the reason why ``match`` is not allowed. Other situation may provide better hints.

This error applies to all PHP keywords. ``match`` is only the most common, as it is a new PHP 8.0 keyword."

description = "Until PHP 8.0, strpos() accepted integers as second argument. Then, it would automagically, transform them into their equivalent. Hence, it returned 2 in PHP 7.4.

In PHP 8.0 and later, the integer is used as a string. Unless the ASCII characters and the string matches, it would return nothing."

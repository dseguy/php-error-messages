description = "strpos() searches for a string called ``$needle`` in another string called ``$haystack``, starting at the offset passed as third argument, and called ``$offset``. 

The offset must be smaller than the full length of the ``$haystack``: otherwise, PHP starts to search beyond the end of the data, and that will always fail. 

This error message is shared by several PHP native and extension functions, namely ``mbstring`` and ``iconv``: ``strpos()``, ``strrpos()``, ``stripos()``, ``strripos()``, ``mb_strpos()``, ``mb_strrpos()``, ``mb_stripos()``, ``mb_strripos()``, ``iconv_strpos`` and ``iconv_strrpos``. 

Before PHP 8.0, the failure was reported as a non-blocking warning. Since PHP 8.0, it is a fatal error."

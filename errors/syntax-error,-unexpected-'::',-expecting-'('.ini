description = "This is a situation where a new keyword degrades a previously valid syntax. ``match`` is a new keyword in PHP 8.0, for the eponymous command. It cannot be used as a class name, a function name, or a global constant, as before. 

By extension, the ``match`` keyword cannot be used in static object notations, such as calling a constant, or a static method or property.

This error may arise with other keywords, for similar reasons."

description = "When resolving name conflicts during trait imports, it is not possible to use ``static`` with the ``as`` keyword. The situation is actually confusing: ``static`` may be the name of the alias, or it could also be understood as the modifier.

The same situation arise with ``abstract``, ``final`` or ``readonly``. On the other hand, it is valid to use the visibility modifier to actually change the visibility on the alias."

description = "``session_set_save_handler()`` used to accept six to to nine distinct callables to configure the handler. In fact, that PHP native function was available even before PHP had objects support. 

Nowadays, there still needs that many callables, but they are expected to be grouped in a class, and checked by the ``SessionHandlerInterface`` interface."
alternative[] = "Refactor the callables into a class, add the ``SessionHandlerInterface`` implementation and use that class."

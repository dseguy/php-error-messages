description = "A static method is also called a class method: it may be executed without a dedicated object. That object is usually made available in the method, via the pseudo variable $this. 

Hence, when a method is marked as static, the variable $this is not made available, and cannot be used. 

In the error message, the 'object context' refers to a class, enum or trait. $this must be localised inside such structures; even more, it is only used in the body of a method of such structure. 

Inside a class, trait or enum, static methods, static closures and static arrow functions shall not use $this. The two last ones are marked also with the static keyword.

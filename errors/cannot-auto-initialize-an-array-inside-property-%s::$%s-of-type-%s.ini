description = "The last command is using the array syntax on the property ``$property``. In fact, the property is of type ``bool``. 

If this was a variable, this would be tolerated, but it cannot happen on a property, which enforces the types at all times. 

Indeed, if the union type ``bool|array`` is used, the automatic conversion to array is reported.

When the type of the property is ``string``, the array syntax is partially supported: it works with integer index, and fails with strings.

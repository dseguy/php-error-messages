description = "It is not possible to put a label inside a loop (for, foreach, while, do...while...) or a switch call. Such statement have to be initialized before execution, and the goto would cut short this crucial step.

On the other hand, it is possible to jump from a loop or a switch to outside that structure: then, it terminates it.

It is also possible to use a goto within a loop and a switch.

This is a compilation error: it is detected before execution."

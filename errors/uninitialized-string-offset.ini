description = "This error appears when using the array syntax on strings, while the requested index is too large, or too small.

An offset is too big when it is beyond the length of the string. An offset is too small with it is below the length of the string, multiplied by -1. All values between [- strlen($string), strlen($string)] are valid.

This error is displayed when the string offset is read. It becomes a 'Illegal string offset' when the syntax is used to write a character.

description = "array_sum() adds each element in the first argument, with each other. This is a valid operation for integers, floats, numeric strings, booleans and null, as they can be cast to numbers. 

This is not the case for arrays, objects, non-numeric strings or resources, which yield this warning, and are omitted in the operation.

Until PHP 8.3, the omission of invalid argument was a silent behavior."

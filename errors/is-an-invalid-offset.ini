description = "The requested value could not be found in the underlying array. 

Indeed, the ``SplDoublyLinkedList`` has only 3 elements, none with the ``4`` index. 

The problem also arise when using ``add`` method, with an index that is negative, or beyond the current last element of the list.

Traditional PHP ``array`` do not report this error: they return ``null``, with the ``Undefined array key`` warning."

description = "With the list() operator, the right part of the => operator must be a variable or equivalent. The corresponding value on the right part of the assignation will be stored there, so it has to be a data container. It is possible to use a variable, property (static or not), an array element or an array append. 

The same error may happen when the property is not available: this may be the case with a nullsafe operator.

This is valid with or without the index part, in the list() call."

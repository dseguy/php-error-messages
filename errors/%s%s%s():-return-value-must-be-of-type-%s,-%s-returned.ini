description = "This error appears when calling a method with a return value, but without an explicit return statement. This means that when the method reachs its end, eventually, it will end without a returned value. Yet, the method signature declares that it will return a specific type.

The error is also emitted for property hooks, in particular the ``get`` one: its return type is the same as the type of the property.

A different error message is returned when an empty ``return`` statement is used."

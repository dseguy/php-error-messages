description = "The ``break`` and ``continue`` operators only accepts a positive integer as explicit operand. 

``break`` and ``continue`` exit from the current loop. By default, it only exits the current loop; when a higher number is passed, they also exit the next loops. 

It makes no sense to exit 0 loops (no need for ``break`` then), or a negative number of loop (call a new ``foreach``). Break only works with literal integers, and doesn't compile otherwise."

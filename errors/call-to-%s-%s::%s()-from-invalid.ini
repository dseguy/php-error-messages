description = "A ``private`` method shall only be called from within its own class. It cannot be called from another class, or from the global space. In particular, the method cannot be called directly, or indirectly: for example, ``new X`` indirectly calls the ``__construct`` method. 

A ``protected`` method shall only be called from within its own class, or any of it parent or children. It cannot be called from another non-related class, or from the global space. In particular, the method cannot be called directly, or indirectly: for example, ``new X`` indirectly calls the ``__construct`` method. 

A ``public`` method may be called from anywhere in the code.

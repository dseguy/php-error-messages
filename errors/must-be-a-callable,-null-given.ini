description = "The ``PDOStatement::fetchAll()`` accepts a 2nd argument as a callback. That method processes the returning rows before they are returned by the method itself. By default, the method returns arrays, and doesn't need the callback. When the callback is provided, it must be a valid callback, and, as such, can't be ``null``.

This error is the same as ""Argument #%d ($name) must be of type %s, %s given"", but is specific to the PDO extension, and the ``PDOStatement::fetchAll()``. The original problem is also the same."

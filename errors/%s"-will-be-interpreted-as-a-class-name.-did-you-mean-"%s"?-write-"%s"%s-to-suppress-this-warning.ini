They are valid for custom code usage, including creating classes or interfaces. To avoid such confusion, PHP emits this error message to make sure that ``integer`` is confused with ``int``.

``boolean``, for ``bool``, ``integer``, for ``int``, ``double``, for ``float``, and ``resource``, for ``\resource``, are all subjects to this error.

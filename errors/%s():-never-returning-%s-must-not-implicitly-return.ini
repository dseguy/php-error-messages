description = "An implicit return is a method reaching the end of its body block, and ending its execution without an explicit ``return`` statement. In fact, PHP executes an implicit return statement, et returns the value ``NULL``. In the case of a method, whose return type is ``never``, this should not happen. There must be a call to ``die``, ``exit``, or ``throw``, or any other mean to prevent this function to reach its normal ending. 

This error is only reported at execution time."
alternative[] = "Add a ``die`` or ``exit`` before the end of the method."

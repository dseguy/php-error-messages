description = "Methods arguments may be passed by value or by reference. The first one is the default behavior, and the second one is optional: it is identified with the ``&``, before the name of the argument.

When an argument is passed by reference, the calling context passes a variable, and conserves a handle to the modified variable after the execution of the method. The handle points to a data container, such as a variable, a property, a static property or a array item. 

When passing literal values or constants, global or class, this error is emitted, as there cannot be a reference to them. They can only be passed by value.

This error message is emitted when a value is returned, and feed into a reference argument."

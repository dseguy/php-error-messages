description = "While it is possible to acquire a reference on an object's property, it is not possible to acquire that reference on a property with hooks. By default, the property hook is returned by value, and cannot accomodate the reference. Unless the property hooks is made by reference, with a ``&`` before the name of the hook.

The message is also related to using an object in a foreach loop. There is a different message for direct creation of a reference on a property."

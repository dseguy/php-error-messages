description = "Until PHP 8.0, it was possible to use array_key_exists() on both arrays, and objects. The objects were considered as an array, where the properties are the indices, linked to their values.

Since PHP 8.0, it is a deprecated behavior, and in a later version, PHP will make the typing more strict.

The other types, such as integer or string, are not accepted either."

description = "An object cannot be converted automatically into a string, without calling a dedicated method, or setting up the magic method called ``__toString``. 

With native PHP operators and functions, the call to ``__toString`` is automagic. With custom functions, it is dependent on the ``strict_types`` configuration: when ``strict_types`` is activated, it prevents the automatic conversion to string, and yields the error."
alternative[] = "Remove the strict_types configuration."
alternative[] = "Add a cast to (string) to explicitely activate the conversion to string."

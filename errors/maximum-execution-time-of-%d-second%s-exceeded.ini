description = "This error indicates that the application has been running for longer than an acceptable amount of time: by default, 30 seconds. 

To avoid working indefinitely on a task, PHP cancels its execution.

It is common to set this duration to low levels, so as to keep execution time short. In a production environement, any such error should be investigated, and refactored.

description = "PHP has several types. They may combined to provide the same type safety one another: PHP reports those situations, and prevents them. 

Here, the ``bool`` type represents ``true|false``. So, when both ``true`` and ``false`` are used in the type, they should be replaced with ``bool``.

``bool|true`` or ``bool|false`` yields another error; ``bool&true`` is not possible, at all."

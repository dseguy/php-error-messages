description = "In this example, ``Match`` is a PHP keyword, and cannot be part of a static call, with the operator ``::``. On the other hand, ``Match`` could be a parameter name, where the ``foo`` function, has a ``$Match`` parameter. Hence, the suggestion to use ``:`` a single colon.

This error may also appear with other keywords, such as ``Switch``. It is also case-insensitive."

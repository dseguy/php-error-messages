description = "The ``property`` property is declared as static, and should be access with the ``::`` operator. 

Accessing that property with the ``->`` or ``?->`` object operators is quite safe, as there is no confusion with the name of the property, and the object holds the name of the host class.

On the other hand, using the object operators does not provide accurate information about the actual property.

description = "This error appears when the declare statement is not the first statement in the file. 

It appears even when non-executing statement are placed before it, such as forgotten characters before the opening tag, any kind of operations in PHP commands, including definitions, namespaces, etc.

Other declare() calls may appears before the strict_types one, though. Also, PHP uses this error with the other declare statement, such as ``ticks`` or ``encoding``. They are very rare though.

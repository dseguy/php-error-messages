The constant may be defined at different places in the code : 

+ In the running code: it could be in a different file, which was not included yet, or later in the code.
+ In a dependency: use the name of the constant to find which dependency defines this constant. Then, make sure the dependency is satisfied.
+ In an extension: use the name of the constant to find which PHP extension defines this constant. For example, ``XML_PI_NODE`` is from the ext/xml extension, which may not be in the current PHP engine.

There is a distinct message for class constants."

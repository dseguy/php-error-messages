description = "The magic method ``__toString`` converts the current object into a string. Hence, and even if the return type of that method is not explicitely set, it MUST return a string.

With strict types, it may only be a string. Without them, integers and booleans are auto cast silently.

Adding the return type or not does not change this behavior. It is actually set, and could not be any other type anyway."

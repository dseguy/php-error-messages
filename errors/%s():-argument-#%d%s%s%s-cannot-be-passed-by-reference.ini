description = "Passing a literal value, a constant or ``$GLOBALS`` where a reference is requested leads to this error. 

For literal and constants, global or class, this is due to the value that can't be modified. It must be put in a variable first.

For ``$GLOBALS``, it is to prevent modifications of its values. It makes the error message a bit surprising. This doesn't apply to other PHP variables.

A reference argument expected a variable, a property, static or not, or an array element. Usually, a variable is the best choice."

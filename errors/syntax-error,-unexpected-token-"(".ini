description = "Parenthesis cannot be placed anywhere, although they have a wide range of applications. In particular, they are used to call methods, by delimiting arguments; and set part of expressions apart.

A class cannot hold a closure, only method, which are functions with a name.

The syntax to call a method on an instantiation ``new x()->foo()`` and ``new x()()`` has been introduced in PHP 8.4."

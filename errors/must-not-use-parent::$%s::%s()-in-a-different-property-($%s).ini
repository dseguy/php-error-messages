description = "Property hooks are actual methods: they can call other methods to fulfill their mission. They may also call the parent' methods, and, as such, they may also call the parent's property hook. This has lead to the syntax ``parent::$properpty::get()``.

This syntax is specific to property hooks, and can only be used inside the same property hook for the same property."

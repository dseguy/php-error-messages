description = "pack() and unpack() convert data between a string representation and another. They both use a format string, passed as first argument, that specifies how the datat of the second argument are transformed. This format string uses a limited set of letters (and ``@``) to express these transformation. Any other character is not recognized and produces this error.

The valid characters are : ``a, A, h, H, c, C, s, S, n, v, i, I, l, L, N, V, q, Q, J, P, f, g, G, d, e, E, x, X, Z, @`` 

The format is checked after collecting the parameters, and before attempting the transformation. "

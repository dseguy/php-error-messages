description = "This error reports that an interface has already been implemented by a parent, and, as such, should not be implemented again. 

For enumerations, it applies to ``BackEnum`` and ``UnitEnum``, as enumerations don't have parents.

For interfaces and classes, it applies to repetitions of interfaces in the implements list. 

It doesn't apply to duplicate implements between a parent and a child class or interface.

It doesn't apply to trait, that have no relationship with interfaces."

This is the case with the visibility options ``public``, ``protected`` and ``private``, which expect a list of property names.

This is also the case with ``global`` and ``static``, which are declaring global and static variables.

Generally speaking, there can be no two successive commas in an expression, except with the ``list()`` keyword."

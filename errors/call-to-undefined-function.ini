description = "This error appears when calling a function that is not defined. 

There should be a function definition in the code, and that definition must be included in the code before it is called. The presence of a function may be tested with the ``function_exists()`` function. 

The function may be defined in a PHP extension, or its core: then, the function has no explicit definition. Its existence may be checked with a call to ``get_defined_function()``, which lists all the functions, at the execution point.  

A function may be disabled in the PHP.ini, using the ``disabled_functions`` directive. Then, the function is totally unknown by PHP, and it may even be redefined. 

Language constructs, such as ``exit`` and ``die``, are not functions, and some features, such as calling them from a string, is not possible until PHP 8.4. 

The function might be defined in a different namespace, or its import might be missing."
alternative[] = "Check the spelling of the function name."
alternative[] = "Check the version of PHP, or its extensions: some functions are defined in specific versions, or later."
alternative[] = "Check the namespace of the called function: it might not be available in the current namespace, or in the global namespace."
alternative[] = "Check the use expression at the beginning of the file: the import expression might be missing."
alternative[] = "Use the function_exists() function before calling a function whose name is stored in a variable."
alternative[] = "Use a try/catch around the function call, and catch Error (not exceptions)."

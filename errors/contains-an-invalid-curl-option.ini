description = "``curl_setopt()`` uses a cURL option as second parameter. These options are PHP native constants, and use the prefix ``CURLOPT_``, which resolve to an integer.

It is possible to use the equivalent integer to set a cURL option, for example via a variable. The value of this variable must be checked to be a valid cURL constant before usage.

Using another type instead of a cURL constant is reported as an error of type."

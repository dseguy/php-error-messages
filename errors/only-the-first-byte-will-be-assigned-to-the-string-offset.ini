description = "The array notation is available with strings, to both write and read. When writing to a string, the new assigned character must be a single character, and even, a single byte. This means that it is not possible to replace multiple characters, or to inject a longer string inside another one with such syntax. 

As a side effect, this also applies to multi-byte characters: since they are represented on two, or more, characters, they cannot be injected in such syntax.

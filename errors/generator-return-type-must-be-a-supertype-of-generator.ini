description = "When a method or a function uses a ``yield`` keyword, it becomes a generator. It also means that the return type of this method must be Generator, or any other of its supertypes: ``Traversable``, ``Iterator``, ``Generator`` or ``iterable``.

There is no way to set a type on the yielded values: only on the returned values. In this case, it will be a ``Generator``. Strangely, any value in a ``return`` expression is also valid.

It may also be simply removed, and left implicit."

description = "This error is emitted when a character outside the range of validity is used. 

In the example above, the ``octdec()`` function converts a string from octal to decimal. Octals are written with figures from 0 to 8. In this case, 9 is excluded. 

The same error is emitted with the other maths bases : for example, using 'a' in a decimal, or 'X' in a hexadecimal, etc.

description = "There can be no return type for certain methods, such as the constructor and the desctructor. 

The constructor is called while creating a new instance of an object, but it doesn't return the object itself.This is the case even if $this is available in the method. 

The destructor is called while destroying an instance, and shall not return anything.

Theses methods must remain without a return type: not ``void``, not ``mixed``, not ``never``, or anthing else."

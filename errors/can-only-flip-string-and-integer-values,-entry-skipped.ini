description = "array_flip() converts values into keys and keys into values. The former values undergo a process to convert them to valid keys, which are strings or integers. 

In general, non-scalar values cannot be converted, and are skipped: this is the case of arrays.

In particular, string or integer backed enumerations and stringeable objects are not converted to strings. This applies with or without strict_types.

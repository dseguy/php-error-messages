description = "In the specific case of the integer division of PHP_MIN_INT by -1, a specific error is reported: the result is not an integer. 

In fact, ``- PHP_INT_MIN = PHP_INT_MAX + 1``: PHP_INT_MIN is larger than PHP_INT_MAX, in absolute value. It implies that multiplying, or dividing it by -1, cannot be represented as a integer. 

Since the ``intdiv()`` has a return type of ``int``, returning a float is not possible. Hence, the specific error. 

Any other argument is valid, as it will be within the range of the integers. 

Last, using the ``/`` operator works, since the operator doesn't have a return type."

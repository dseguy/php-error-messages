description = "fopen()'s first argument is of type string, though the empty string is not allowed, as it does not lead to any file.

This check prevents using an empty string, or its equivalent as ``null`` or ``false``, to access a file. 

This error also applies to ``file_get_contents`` and ``file_put_contents()``. It doesn't apply to ``unlink`` and ``rmdir``."

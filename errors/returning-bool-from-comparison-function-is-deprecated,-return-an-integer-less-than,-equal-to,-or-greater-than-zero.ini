description = "``usort()`` requires a callback function, that is used to put set the order in the array. This function must return three different values: 

+ 1 if ``$a > $b``
+ 0 if ``$a == $b``
+ -1 if ``$a < $b``

The return type should be the integer subset ``[1, 0, -1]``, and since there is no such type in PHP, the ``int`` type shall be used. 

This is exactly compatible with the spaceship operator ``<=>``. 

Also, note that any positive integer is considered as 1, and any negative integer is considered as -1. 

This applies to ``usort()``, ``uasort()``, ``uksort()``. 

Not that without ``declare(strict_types=)``, the integer result of the callback is converted into a boolean, where 1 and -1 are both ``true``. This may lead to strange results."

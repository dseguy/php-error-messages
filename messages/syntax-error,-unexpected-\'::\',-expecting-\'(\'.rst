Description
___________
 
This is a situation where a new keyword degrades a previously valid syntax. ``match`` is a new keyword in PHP 8.0, for the eponymous command. It cannot be used as a class name, a function name, or a global constant, as before. 

By extension, the ``match`` keyword cannot be used in static object notations, such as calling a constant, or a static method or property.

This error may arise with other keywords, for similar reasons.


Example
_______

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   
   echo Match::A;
   
   ?>

Solutions
_________

+ Rename the ``match`` class to a non-keyword name.

Description
___________
 
This error is raised when a parameter was provided with an infinite value. 

Infinite values are generated by maths functions such as ``atan`` or ``log``, and also with the ``INF`` and ``NAN`` constants. Infinite values are considered to be typed ``float``.

For example, ``stream_socket_client()`` and  ``stream_socket_accept()`` require a ``$timeout`` parameter, and it is tempting, but not valid, to provide ``INF``.

Example
_______

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   
   $fp = stream_socket_client(tcp://www.example.com:80, $errno, $errstr, INF);
   
   ?>

Solutions
_________

+ Use a very large, but finite float value, such as ``PHP_FLOAT_MAX``, which will be valid until the end of the universe, even in nanoseconds.

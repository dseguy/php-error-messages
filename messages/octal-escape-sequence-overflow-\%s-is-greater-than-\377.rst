Description
___________
 
Octal escape is a notation for double quoted strings, where a backslash followed by 3 digits is replaced by the character with this ASCII number. These ASCII numbers have a limit of 0o377. 

Between ``0o377`` and ``0o777``, numbers are valid octals, and not ASCII numbers, so the error message appears. 

Beyond ``0o777``, the sequence is not a valid octal anymore, and PHP does not process it, nor emit an error message.

Example
_______

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   
   $a = "\500";
   ?>

Solutions
_________

+ Check the value in the octal sequence to be valid.
+ Add backslashes, to make the characters literals.

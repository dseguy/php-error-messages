Description
___________
 
PHP has encountered a closing curly brackets, but has no related opening curly bracket. 

In more complex situations, there might be opening and closing brackets: this error reports that there are more closing ones than opening. Eventually, some will not have a matching bracket.

Inside double-quoted strings, the unmatched closing brackets are ignored, and used as literal value. 


Example
_______

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   
   $a = 1 + 2}
   
   // 3 opening, 4 closing. 
   {{{$b = 1 + 2}}}}
   
   // this unmatched closing bracket is taken as literal
   $b = "$a} = 1+2"; 
   
   ?>

Solutions
_________

+ Remove the closing curly bracket.
+ Add an opening closing curly bracket.
